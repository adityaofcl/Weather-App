# Weather-App
I'm excited to share my latest project developed during my internship at CodeClause!
I built a dynamic Weather Forecasting App that allows users to search for any city's weather details and displays real-time data, including temperature, weather description, humidity, and pressure.

ðŸ”¹ Features:

Real-time weather updates using the OpenWeatherMap API

Detailed weather info: temperature, humidity, pressure

User-friendly interface with weather icons based on conditions

Error handling: Vibration feedback for invalid city searches

ðŸ”§ Technologies Used:

HTML, CSS, JavaScript

OpenWeatherMap API

Asynchronous JavaScript (async/await)

This project has been a great learning experience, enhancing my skills in web development and API integration.
